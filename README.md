[![Scheduled Data Scraper](https://github.com/nashicorp/wdfw-high-lakes-history/actions/workflows/scrape.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/nashicorp/wdfw-high-lakes-history/actions/workflows/scrape.yml)

Uses [Git Scraping](https://simonwillison.net/series/git-scraping/) to track fish stocking data in Washington High Lakes.

This data is retrieved daily from the [Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife High lakes](https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/locations/high-lakes) site and contains up to the 10 most recent stocking events for each lake.

The [Flat Viewer](https://flatgithub.com/nashicorp/wdfw-high-lakes-history?filename=high_lakes_plants_flattened.json) is available to view the data in a table for easy sorting and filtering.
