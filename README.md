Uses [Git Scraping](https://simonwillison.net/series/git-scraping/) to track fish stocking data in Washington High Lakes.

This data is retrieved daily from the [Washington Department of Fish & Wildlife High lakes](https://wdfw.wa.gov/fishing/locations/high-lakes) site and contains up to the 10 most recent stocking events for each lake.

See the [Flat Viewer](https://flatgithub.com/nashicorp/wdfw-high-lakes-history?filename=high_lakes_plants_flattened.json) to see the data in a table for easy sorting and filtering.
